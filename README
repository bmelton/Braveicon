Braveicon is a simple tool used to get the favicon url from a webpage. 

I developed it for plum, when I realized that there weren't any other
particularly viable tools out there to do it with in Python. 

Braveicon requires BeautifulSoup, and works on python2.6. 

To use Braveicon in your project, just do the following:

` import braveicon
` braveicon.get_favicon(url)

Braveicon will accept most urls -- I provide mine in shorthand (e.g., 
"sympodial.com" vs "http://sympodial.com", but it will do its best
to figure that out for you, and should accept pretty much anything
normal. 

Braveicon will try to find favicons using the W3C "link rel='icon'" 
attributes in the head first (gotta respect the spec), followed by
"link rel='shortcut icon'" links, and will fall back to /favicon.ico 
links if all those fail.

   Software as a service that I would have used, except that they're
     actually rendering an image as a file, and every request goes
     through their service.
